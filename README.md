# Markdown Preview Kramdown package

Since different Markdown implementation will differ a little, I make this package to let people check the articles on GitHub on Atom.   

Show the rendered HTML markdown to the right of the current editor using <kbd>ctrl-shift-m</kbd>.

It is currently enabled for `.markdown`, `.md`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdown`, `.ron`, and `.txt` files.
